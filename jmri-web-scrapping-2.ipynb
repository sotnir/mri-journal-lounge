with R-MCA undergoing stenting before (top row) and after (bottom row) surgery. A 65-year-old male with severe R-MCA stenosis. (a) DSA showed that after stenting, the R-MCA stenosis was significantly alleviated, the blood flow was recanalized, and the distal branches were well visualized. (b) DWI showed no obvious high signal before and after the operation. (c) Preoperative 3D pcASL showed that low perfusion area was visible in M6, and postoperative low perfusion had returned to normal. (d) and (e) Preoperative tASL showed that the perfusion in M3, M5, and M6 areas was lower than that of the contralateral side, and the postoperative hypoperfusion area had returned to normal by Wang et al (175–183).\n","                    </p>\n","                   </div>\n","                  </div>\n","                  <div class=\"content-item-format-links\">\n","                   <ul class=\"rlist--inline separator issue-item__links\">\n","                    <li>\n","                     <a href=\"/doi/abs/10.1002/jmri.27227\" title=\"Abstract\">\n","                      Abstract\n","                     </a>\n","                    </li>\n","                    <li class=\"PdfLink\">\n","                     <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jmri.27227\" title=\"EPDF\">\n","                      PDF\n","                     </a>\n","                    </li>\n","                    <li>\n","                     <a href=\"/servlet/linkout?type=rightslink&amp;url=publisherName=Wiley%26publication=JMRI%26contentID=10.1002%252Fjmri.27227\" target=\"_blank\">\n","                      Request permissions\n","                     </a>\n","                    </li>\n","                   </ul>\n","                  </div>\n","                 </div>\n","                </div>\n","                <div class=\"issue-items-container bulkDownloadWrapper\">\n","                 <h3 class=\"toc__heading section__header to-section\" id=\"heading-level-1-2\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Issue Information\">\n","                  Issue Information\n","                 </h3>\n","                 <div class=\"issue-item\">\n","                  <div class=\"pull-left\">\n","                   <div class=\"doi-access-wrapper\">\n","                    <div class=\"free-access access-type\">\n","                     <i aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"icon-icon-lock_open\">\n","                     </i>\n","                     <div class=\"doi-access\" tabindex=\"0\">\n","                      Free Access\n","                     </div>\n","                    </div>\n","                   </div>\n","                  </div>\n","                  <div class=\"clearfix\">\n","                  </div>\n","                  <div class=\"clearfix\">\n","                  </div>\n","                  <div class=\"bulkDownloadInput\">\n","                   <input data-has-pdf=\"true\" title=\"Select article for bulk download or export: Issue Information\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"10.1002/jmri.27228\"/>\n","                   <div class=\"hidden\">\n","                    free\n","                   </div>\n","                  </div>\n","                  <a class=\"issue-item__title visitable\" href=\"/doi/10.1002/jmri.27228\">\n","                   <h2>\n","                    Issue Information\n","                   </h2>\n","                  </a>\n","                  <ul class=\"rlist--inline separator issue-item__details\" style=\"float: none;
