Regions of interest were positioned in diffusely abnormal white matter (Red Circles) and posterior periventricular normal appearing white matter (NAWM) (Black Circles). Measurements were, also, made in focal lesions identified on T2-weighted images, varying on their intensity on T1-weighted images (see materials and methods section). In this section A T1 isointense focal lesion (White Circles) and a T1 moderate hypointense focal lesion (Yellow Circles) are shown. According to the results, MWF and T2 values were intermediate between the respective values of NAWM and T1 hypointense focal lesions, but not significantly different from T1 isointense lesions by papadaki et al (1077–1087)\n","                    </p>\n","                   </div>\n","                  </div>\n","                  <div class=\"content-item-format-links\">\n","                   <ul class=\"rlist--inline separator issue-item__links\">\n","                    <li>\n","                     <a href=\"/doi/abs/10.1002/jmri.27233\" title=\"Abstract\">\n","                      Abstract\n","                     </a>\n","                    </li>\n","                    <li class=\"PdfLink\">\n","                     <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jmri.27233\" title=\"EPDF\">\n","                      PDF\n","                     </a>\n","                    </li>\n","                    <li>\n","                     <a href=\"/servlet/linkout?type=rightslink&amp;url=publisherName=Wiley%26publication=JMRI%26contentID=10.1002%252Fjmri.27233\" target=\"_blank\">\n","                      Request permissions\n","                     </a>\n","                    </li>\n","                   </ul>\n","                  </div>\n","                 </div>\n","                </div>\n","                <div class=\"issue-items-container bulkDownloadWrapper\">\n","                 <h3 class=\"toc__heading section__header to-section\" id=\"heading-level-1-2\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Issue Information\">\n","                  Issue Information\n","                 </h3>\n","                 <div class=\"issue-item\">\n","                  <div class=\"pull-left\">\n","                   <div class=\"doi-access-wrapper\">\n","                    <div class=\"free-access access-type\">\n","                     <i aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"icon-icon-lock_open\">\n","                     </i>\n","                     <div class=\"doi-access\" tabindex=\"0\">\n","                      Free Access\n","                     </div>\n","                    </div>\n","                   </div>\n","                  </div>\n","                  <div class=\"clearfix\">\n","                  </div>\n","                  <div class=\"clearfix\">\n","                  </div>\n","                  <div class=\"bulkDownloadInput\">\n","                   <input data-has-pdf=\"true\" title=\"Select article for bulk download or export: Issue Information\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"10.1002/jmri.27234\"/>\n","                   <div class=\"hidden\">\n","                    free\n","                   </div>\n","                  </div>\n","                  <a class=\"issue-item__title visitable\" href=\"/doi/10.1002/jmri.27234\">\n","                   <h2>\n","                    Issue Information\n","                   </h2>\n","                  </a>\n","                  <ul class=\"rlist--inline separator issue-item__details\" style=\"float: none;

Regions of interest were positioned in diffusely abnormal white matter (Red Circles) and posterior periventricular normal appearing white matter (NAWM) (Black Circles). Measurements were, also, made in focal lesions identified on T2-weighted images, varying on their intensity on T1-weighted images (see materials and methods section). In this section A T1 isointense focal lesion (White Circles) and a T1 moderate hypointense focal lesion (Yellow Circles) are shown. According to the results, MWF and T2 values were intermediate between the respective values of NAWM and T1 hypointense focal lesions, but not significantly different from T1 isointense lesions by papadaki et al (1077–1087)\n","\n","                     \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","AbstractPDFRequest permissions\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Issue Information\n","\n","Free Access\n","\n","\n","free\n","\n","Issue Information\n","Pages: 1029-1038\n","First Published: 14 September 2021\n","\n","\n","\n","First PagePDFRequest permissions\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Review Article\n","\n","Full Access\n","\n","\n","full\n","\n","MRI of Temporomandibular Joint Disorders: Recent Advances and Future Directions\n","\n"," Xin Xiong PhD, \n"," Zheng Ye PhD, \n"," Hehan Tang PhD, \n"," Yi Wei PhD, \n"," Lisha Nie PhD, \n"," Xiaocheng Wei PhD, \n"," Yang Liu PhD, \n"," Bin Song MD, \n","\n","\n","Pages: 1039-1052\n","First Published: 31 August 2020\n","\n","\n","\n","Abstract\n","\n","                    Full text\n","                PDF\n","ReferencesRequest permissions\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Research Articles\n","\n","Neuro\n","\n","Open Access\n","\n","\n","oa\n","\n","Multi-Parametric Evaluation of Cerebral Hemodynamics in Neonatal Piglets Using Non-Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Methods\n","\n"," Dapeng Liu PhD, \n"," Dengrong Jiang PhD, \n"," Aylin Tekes MD, \n"," Ewa Kulikowicz MS, \n"," Lee J.
