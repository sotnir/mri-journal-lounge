# UHS MRIPhysics Journal Review System

This is a github repository that collects scripts that perform web or pdf scrapping of journal contents, to enable periodic review of relevant journal contents for the MRI Physics team at University Hospial Southampton NHS Foundation Trust.

## Motivation

To come up with a system to review the contents pages of relevant journals periodically. There are many useful papers but our time are limited. However, one can have a quick look at those titles and find topics of interests.
 
An idea would be to develop a web/pdf scrapping script using python can quickly grasp these info (can start with journal name, volume, issue, title) into a cleaned spreadsheet that's stored somewhere. The papers then may be ranked as being more or less relevant.
