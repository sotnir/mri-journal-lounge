# UHS MRI Physics Team Journal Lounge

[![Open In Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/studiolab.svg)](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/import/github/sotnir/mri-journal-lounge/blob/main/jmri-web-scrapping-demo.ipynb)

This repository collects scripts that perform web scrapping of journal contents for the MRI Physics Team at University Hospial Southampton NHS Foundation Trust.

## Motivation

Our team loves reading papers and sharing what we found interesting. We would like do this more regularly and more efficiently. In the past there wasn't a systematic way to allow us to periodically review the contents of relevant journals. We are quite busy at the same time, whilst there are many useful papers out there. We thought it might be a good idea to first gather the key information of papers together. For example, one may quickly skim through the titles and find "that's interesting, let me mark it and I'll come back to it later", all in one place. 

This leads to an idea of using script to do web scrapping, collect relevant contents to a cleaned spreadsheet, and store in a shared space. On that spreadsheet, the papers then may be marked or ranked as being more or less relevant by each of the team member. 

## Relevant Contents 

Our team decided that the following information are relevant and should be put on spreadsheet:

- Journal name
- Volume/Issue
- Category of the paper
- Title of the paper
- Date first published
- A permanent DOI address, to quickly get to the article
    - one may look up [here](https://github.com/yukaizou2015/UHS-MRIPhysics-journal-web-scrapping/edit/main/README.md#how-to-request-journal-articles) if cannot access the full article
- A "note" column for each of the team member

## Meeting Schedule

The journal club is currently being held on a monthly basis.

## Target Journals and Platforms

Our team has chosen the following two journals:

- [Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (JMRI)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15222586)
- [Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (MRM)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15222594)

An overview can be found from the ISMRM website [here](https://www.ismrm.org/membership-journals/journals/).

### Color Label

Each team member will update the spreadsheet that collects the JMRI contents by using the assigned color label to mark paper of relevance:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yukaizou2015/UHS-MRIPhysics-journal-web-scrapping/main/img/jmri-team-color.png)

 - Highlight *first column only* if the paper is of interest. Other team members may highlight other columns with their color labels as well.

### JMRI spreadsheet

The spreadsheet for collecting JMRI contents may be accessed at the link [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-4spJ677WzYBpuzcnHu_gO0mSnoR29mk/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117155765040566319388&rtpof=true&sd=true).

### ISMRM 2022 London Annual Conference

Our team has a highlight board using Padlet which is available [here](https://padlet.com/yukaizou2012/1pegs3rgjxjq41rm).

All the proceedings can be accessed [here](https://submissions.mirasmart.com/ISMRM2022/itinerary/Default.aspx?Refresh=1). To quickly find all the abstract you may use this very cool [ISMRM unofficial search app](https://ismrm2022-unofficial.netlify.app/).

### MRM Highlights Discourse

To visit the forum, click [here](http://mrm.ismrm.org/). This is a forum where MRM readers can register (for free) and post informal comments and questions about papers on MRM. Currently the most downloaded 20% of MRM papers per issue are listed, and specific additional papers may be listed on request at mrm@ismrm.org.

### BIC-ISMRM Highlights & Discussion Forum

The forum can be accessed [here](https://padlet.com/petelally/8rohqk9dxuon5je8). This is a place where highlights from the ISMRM 2021 Annual Meeting are collected by postdocs and students from the British & Irish Chapters, all in one place and with discussions.

## How To Request Journal Articles

**NOTE: You would need credentials from University of Southampton.**

You can request journal articles using the [WebCat](https://www-lib.soton.ac.uk/) service provided by the Health Services Library at University of Southampton. To do so:
 1. Login to [WebCat](https://www-lib.soton.ac.uk/) using your Username/Password credentials
 2. At the navigation bar, select "Requests & Document Supply - Restricted (Covid-19)"
 3. Click on "Request something not available in our collections"
 4. Click on "Requests for Journals/Articles (including pages from)"
 5. Enter information about the journal articles. Supply as much info as you can so that the requested item can be found more quickly. Also indicate which department you're based at the University/NHS.
 6. After entering all the information, click on "Place Request". You will be notified about the status of the requested item, which normally takes one or two working days to process, and typically a PDF of the requested article.

## How To Access Electronic Book

**NOTE: You would need credentials from University of Southampton.**

Sometimes the Library may decide to purchase your requested item as an electronic book for library stock. Here a step-by-step instruction for how to get access, using "Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Volume 1, 1st Edition" by Seiberlich et al. as an example:

1. Go to [Health Services Library](https://library.soton.ac.uk/hsl)
2. Find "Seiberlich Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging”
3. In Item Details, click on the link "EBSCOhost: View online”
4. In the drop-down list of View All Institutions, select "UK Higher Education”, then “University of Southampton”
5. Enter your university credentials
