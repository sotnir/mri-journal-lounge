# UHS MRI Physics Team Journal Lounge

This Github repository mainly collects scripts that perform web scrapping of journal contents, to enable periodic review of relevant journal contents for the MRI Physics Team at University Hospial Southampton NHS Foundation Trust.

## Motivation

Our team needs a solution, essentially a more systematic way, to periodically review the contents of relevant journals. There are many useful papers which we may not read given limited time. However, one can have a quick look at those titles and find topics of interests. An idea would be to use a web scrapping script to collect these info to a cleaned spreadsheet and store in a shared space. On the spreadsheet the papers then may be marked or ranked as being more or less relevant. Relevant info can include: Journal name, Volume/Issue, Category, Title, Date first published, and a DOI url link.

## Targeted Journals

The ISMRM publishes two journals, [Magnetic Resonance in Medicine](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15222594) and [Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15222586). An overview can be found [here](https://www.ismrm.org/membership-journals/journals/).

### MRM Highlights Discourse

This is a forum where MRM readers can register (for free) and post informal comments and questions about papers on MRM. Currently the most downloaded 20% of MRM papers per issue are listed, and specific additional papers may be listed on request at mrm@ismrm.org. *Every month a coveted MRM-branded Bluetooth Key Finder will be awarded to the person with the most posts*.
