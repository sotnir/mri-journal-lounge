# Welcome

## Motivation

Our team loves reading papers and sharing what we found interesting. We would like do this more regularly and more efficiently. In the past there wasn't a systematic way to allow us to periodically review the contents of relevant journals. We are quite busy at the same time, whilst there are many useful papers out there. We thought it might be a good idea to first gather the key information of papers together. For example, one may quickly skim through the titles and find "that's interesting, let me mark it and I'll come back to it later", all in one place. This leads to an idea of using script to do web scraping, collect relevant contents to a cleaned spreadsheet, and store in a shared space. On that spreadsheet, the papers then may be marked or ranked as being more or less relevant by each of the team member.

## How it works

If you are interested in what's going on behind the scene, you are welcome to take a look at the Jupyter notebook tutorial below:

[![Open In Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/studiolab.svg)](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/import/github/sotnir/mri-journal-lounge/blob/main/jmri-web-scrapping-demo.ipynb)

# Logistics

## Target Journal

Our team has chosen [Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (JMRI)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15222586). An overview of the journal content can be found from the ISMRM website [here](https://www.ismrm.org/membership-journals/journals/).

## Relevant Contents

The following information from the journal will be recorded on spreadsheet:

- Journal name
- Volume/Issue
- Category of the paper
- Title of the paper
- Date first published
- A permanent DOI address, to quickly get to the article
- A "note" column for each of the team member

## Color Labels

Each team member will update the JMRI spreadsheet by using the assigned color label to mark paper of relevance:

**Note**: Only highlight _the first column_ if the paper is of interest, and other team members may highlight additional columns if they found the articles are interesting.

3.  Enter information about the journal articles. Supply as much info as you can so that the requested item can be found more quickly.
4.  After entering all the information, click on "Submit request". You will be notified about the status of the requested item, which normally takes one or two working days to process, and typically a PDF of the requested article.

## How to Access Electronic Book

**NOTE: You would need credentials from University of Southampton.**

Sometimes the Library may decide to purchase your requested item as an electronic book for library stock. Here a step-by-step instruction for how to get access, using "Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Volume 1, 1st Edition" by Seiberlich et al. as an example:

1. Go to [Health Services Library](https://library.soton.ac.uk/hsl)
